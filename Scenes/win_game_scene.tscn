I can hardly believe it, but I’m back. The last few weeks feel like a blur—between evading pirate ambushes, scavenging every scrap of metal from derelict ships, and narrowly escaping alien swarms, I thought I'd never see home again. The ship's hull is battered but holds together, thanks to a few hasty repairs and a cargo hold full of salvage. With the last of the fuel reserves, I managed to power up the hyperdrive just in time to avoid a final collision with an asteroid belt. As the blue-green planet came into view, it was like seeing an old friend. I’ve survived the chaos of deep space and made it back to where it all began. Now, it’s time to refuel, repair, and maybe take a well-earned rest. Earth never looked so good.
